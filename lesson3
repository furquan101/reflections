Making changes directly on GitHub
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It would be best to do this if you are working with a team, especially if they

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This can disrupt your workflow by pulling in new lines of code or removing code you maybe using
