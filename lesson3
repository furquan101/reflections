Making changes directly on GitHub
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It would be best to do this if you are working with a team, especially if they 
are based in a different country this will help significantly. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This can disrupt your workflow by pulling in new lines of code or removing code you maybe using 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is getting another repositrys code and cloning it into you're own workspace. 
This way your changes won't affect the main persons repo and will only affect 
your own version. 

Cloning is getting the master repo and getting an exact copy onto your local

Branching is getting an existing branch in a repo and copying it to make 
changes only to that new branch and not affecting the master


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefits of this can be significant if someone has been working on the same code of you
you need to sort out the conflict otherwise you won't be able to push your changes, 
also this can save a lot of hassle in the long run.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
You could use another version control system, git may take a little more practise to get use to 
but has a lot more features.
